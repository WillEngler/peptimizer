### Information on CPP data preparation for the regression model

The [CPP predictor dataset](https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/peptimizer/blob/master/dataset/data_cpp/cpp_predictor_dataset.csv) was prepared by combining the 576 peptides synthesized as a part of the Doctoral thesis of Justin M Wolfe [[1]](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/118278), and 64 peptides reported in [[2]](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.8b00098).

Preparation of the dataset by combining the 4 cell-targeting, 3 nuclear-localizing and 48 cell-penetrating modules has been shown in a separate Excel file - [CPP-Data.xlsx](https://github.com/learningmatter-mit/peptimizer/blob/master/dataset/data_cpp/CPP-Data.xlsx). The Excel file also lists the 64 individual cell penetrating peptides.
